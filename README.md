ATF cladding irradiation using SRIM
Enables to 
  execute multiple TRIM input files in a batch,
  process the outputs of TRIM simulations, 
  calculate distribution of radiation damage, 
  create plots of radiation damage distribution,
  optimize the irradiation process consisting of irradiation by multiple ion beams of different energies in order to receive possibly   homogenious damage distribution.
